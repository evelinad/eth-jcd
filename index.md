# ETH - Java and C# in Depth Project

* Group Members: Benjamin Steger, Gregor Wegberg
* Group: jcd_batman

## Important!
* Please note that we did not write tests for the Command Line Interface. It was heavily used while developing and is a nice to have for the project.
* Do not run all tests inside the project. Just run the tests inside `test/`. The test inside `slowtests/` will create two pretty big files and is slow.
